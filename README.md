# Analysis-of-Liver-Cancer
Liver cancer happens when liver cells develop changes (mutations) in their DNA. Several types of cancer can form in the liver. The most common type of liver cancer is hepatocellular carcinoma, which begins in the main type of liver cell (hepatocyte). Other types of liver cancer, such as intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma and hepatoblastoma, are much less common. This project shows the mortality from liver cancer from 1990 to 2019, broken down by region. You will see the regions with the highest mortality and those with the lowest mortality and a comparison between them. At the end of the project, there is a comparison between liver cancer mortality and total mortality from all cancers.
